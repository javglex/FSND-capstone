## API Reference

This project is a backend API for viewing and managing listings such as in ecommerce. A listing represents an item that will be put up for sale. The reason why I wanted to create this API is because I want to expand it and use it for a real world project.

### Getting Started
- Base URL: This app can run either locally or from Heroku. Backend app is set to be hosted locally in `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, and on Heroku in `https://fsnd-capstone-javi.herokuapp.com/`
- Authentication: Auth0.
- NOTE: we only have one existing user in DB (user_id = 1). Use this ID when creating new listings. In future projects, we will automatically create user IDs with Auth0 hooks.


## To run application:

### You should have setup.sh and requirements.txt available
chmod +x setup.sh
source setup.sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
#### Run the app
python3 app.py

### Run tests
dropdb postgres_test 
createdb postgres_test
python3 test_api.py

### Getting User Token
Login/Signup using`https://dev-3y22uvpavowk2d67.us.auth0.com/authorize?audience=showmesandiego.listings&response_type=token&client_id=IKzxbUqeXYz7WYKSfxOPAbom3sZ37LbN&redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/login-results`

For account with Venue permissions (update,delete,patch listings) use `merchanttest@yopmail.com` with pass `abc@1234`

### Error Handling
Errors are JSON responses formatted in the following:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The following are error codes that can potentially be returned by the API:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable
